Hi! My name is Kalina, and Iâ€™m currently a junior studying Computer Science and Accounting at the University of Utah.

Coming from hardworking and selfless Vietnamese parents, I grew up with a strong desire to help others and give back to my community. However, because of my love for logic and problem-solving, I often struggled to find a career path that satisfied both my analytical side and my drive to make a positive impact. Often I felt like pursuing a career in tech was contradictory or even selfish, but Iâ€™ve come to realize that a job doesnâ€™t define who you are and that there are many ways to contribute to society.

While pursuing a career in web development, I've interested myself in topics such as web accessibility, aiming to create websites that are not only functional but also inclusive and user-friendly. I often catch myself noticing small design or usability issues on websites and thinking about how they could be improved. Knowing that small design/functionality changes can help everyday users like me have a better experience motivates me to continue pursuing web development.
