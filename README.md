Coming from hardworking and selfless Vietnamese parents, I grew up with a strong desire to help others and give back to my community. From taking on chores and learning how to fix things myself in order to help reduce my parents' workload, to volunteering at dozens of places, my mission has persisted, but now I am finding ways to use my expertise in Computer Science to do the same. 

My experience spans both front-end and back-end development, from responsive layouts with HTML5 and CSS3, to managing databases with SQL, Django, and APIs. Currently, I serve as the volunteer Web Developer for a local nonprofit, where Iâ€™m revamping their site design to improve accessibility and highlight their mission. Previously, as an Accounting Intern at Elite Accountants Inc., I worked in a team environment under mentorship guidance and successfully streamlined data migration that improved team efficiency during tax season.
